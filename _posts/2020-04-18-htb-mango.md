## Host Enumeration

As usual, we begin with an nmap scan to identify listening services.

- 22: OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu
- 80: Apache httpd 2.4.29
- 443: Apache httpd (SSL-only mode)

### Enumeration - HTTP (80)

The HTTP service home page responds with HTTP 403 - Forbidden... After running a Gobuster scan with the dirb/common.txt wordlist, we didn't get any further results. So let's move on to HTTPS enumeration

### Enumeration - HTTPS (443)

Naturally, when navigating to this page, we get a warning from our browser that the certificate is self-signed and cannot be trusted. Anyways, lets take a closer look at the certificate before we accept the warning. We get some interesting information here. The issuer/issued common name (CN) is `staging-order.mango.htb`, so that is a subdomain. We also see in the details tab that the issuer email is `admin@mango.htb`. Let's note these down and move on.

Once accepting the risk, we land on a Mango page, which looks similar to Google. However, it seems that when search requests are sent, we just get redirected back to the Mango page. On the top right, we see an `analytics.php` page. Within this page, there a bunch of statisics on the average of startup density for different states in USA. Hmm, not really able to find any injection point here. Let's take a look at the subdomain.
