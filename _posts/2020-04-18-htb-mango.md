## Host Enumeration

As usual, we begin with an nmap scan to identify listening services.

- 22: OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu
- 80: Apache httpd 2.4.29
- 443: Apache httpd (SSL-only mode)

### Enumeration - HTTP (80)

The HTTP service home page responds with HTTP 403 - Forbidden... After running a Gobuster scan with the dirb/common.txt wordlist, we didn't get any further results. So let's move on to HTTPS enumeration

### Enumeration - HTTPS (443)

Naturally, when navigating to this page, we get a warning from our browser that the certificate is self-signed and cannot be trusted. Anyways, lets take a closer look at the certificate before we accept the warning. We get some interesting information here. The issuer/issued common name (CN) is `staging-order.mango.htb`, so that is a subdomain. We also see in the details tab that the issuer email is `admin@mango.htb`. Let's note these down and move on.

Once accepting the risk, we land on a Mango page, which looks similar to Google. However, it seems that when search requests are sent, we just get redirected back to the Mango page. On the top right, we see an `analytics.php` page. Within this page, there a bunch of statisics on the average of startup density for different states in USA. Hmm, not really able to find any injection point here. Let's take a look at the subdomain.

## Suspicious Website (staging-order)

The suspicious website is: `http://staging-order.mango.com`

This page points to a login page, and we see some mangos.

We already have a potential username from the SSL certificate (`admin@mango.htb`), but we don't know the password yet. I was stuck on this part for a while and eventually loaded the request into Burp repeater. Failed logins get a HTTP 200 response and we re-load the login page. I suppose that we need to perform some sort of injection to get in. However, none of the normal SQL injection payloads were successful e.g. `' or 1=1; -- -`. But, the name Mango alludes to a different type of DMBS => mongo.

This is where I turned to PayloadAllTheThings Github repository which had a page on MongoDB injection payloads. I just went through these one by one and eventually got a different response where we can know that there was some injection.

```txt
# Normal HTTP request parameters
username=admin&password=admin&login=login
=> HTTP 200 response, failed login

# With MongoDB injection
username[$ne]=toto&password[$ne]=toto&login=login
=> HTTP 302 response, successful login
```

The reason that `username[$ne]=toto` as a parameter worked is because the `$ne` flag means not equal. So we have some potential blind injection here. We can move forward and guesstimate some usernames
